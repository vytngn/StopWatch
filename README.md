This is a simple Java program that implements a stopwatch with a graphical user interface (GUI) using Jswing. The program has three buttons - Start, Stop and Reset.

### How to Run
Clone or download the repository to your local machine.  
Open the project in an IDE that supports Java such as Eclipse or NetBeans.  
Build and run the program.  
The GUI of the stopwatch will appear on your screen.  
Click on the "Start" button to start the stopwatch.  
Click on the "Stop" button to stop the stopwatch.  
Click on the "Reset" button to reset the stopwatch.
### How it Works
The program uses Jswing to create a graphical user interface for the stopwatch.  
The "Start" button starts a timer that counts the elapsed time in milliseconds.  
The "Stop" button stops the timer and displays the elapsed time in a label.  
The "Reset" button resets the timer and label to zero.

### Example
Suppose we want to time a running event using the stopwatch. We can use the program by clicking on the "Start" button when the event starts, and then clicking on the "Stop" button when the event ends. The program will display the elapsed time in milliseconds.

### Conclusion
This simple Java program demonstrates the use of Jswing to create a GUI for a stopwatch. It can be easily modified or integrated into a larger project for more advanced use cases.
